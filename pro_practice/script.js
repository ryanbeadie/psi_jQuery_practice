  Write code to make the number on the DOM countdown each second.
  Only one number should be displayed on the DOM at a time.

  HINT: look into javascript's setInterval() function.


  BONUS 1: Add a button for the user to reset the timer.
  BONUS 2: Make something cool happen using a jQuery animation when the timer gets to zero.
